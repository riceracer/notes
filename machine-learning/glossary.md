### AutoML

Google project to use ML to explore neural network architecture using reinforcement learning.

### CIFAR-10

60k 32x32 color images of 10 classes,6000 images per class.
* https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
* Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

### COCO

Common Objects in Context - dataset of 300K images of 80 most common object categories.
* http://cocodataset.org/

### Feature Extraction

Transforming data, such as text and images, into numerical features that can be used by machine learning.

### One-hot Coding

Encoding for categorical, non-ordinal features: given K categories, create a binary feature for each of the categories.

* Downsides: for high cardinality this results in sparse high-dimensional data.

### Penn Treebank
 
University of Pennsylvania dataset of 1 million works annotated in Treebank II style, fully tagged version of Brown Corpus.
