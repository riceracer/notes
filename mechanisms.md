## Ops improvement

### Ticket root cause analysis

* Aggregate all tickets over a time period (1 quarter or 1/2 year or 1 year).
* Count tickets by root cause (either given root cause or via re-categorizing them)
* For root cause groups, combine or further refine categories to map root causes to work items to address the root causes
* Prioritize fixes by count and/or severity- ensure fixes are deep/not shallow and prevent additional instances of the same error type in the future.
* Repeat process after 3 months and ensure that prior root cause fixes worked as expected.
